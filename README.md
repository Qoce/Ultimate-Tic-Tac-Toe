# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe
A Java program I wrote that plays ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe against the user.  Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a more complicated version of Tic-Tac-Toe in which a large tic tac toe board contains a smaller board in each of its squares. The position within the small board that the previous move was played determines the board that the next player is allowed to play in.  Currently the computer plays against a human player, using a minimax search tree. The winner is the player who wins the most of the small boards.
